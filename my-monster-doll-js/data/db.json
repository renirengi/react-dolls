Her hair is pulled into a pony tail with a hair bump and is held by a red hairband adorned with a skullette surrounded by feathers.\nShe is wearing a purple & blue leaf print top with black faux fur shoulders and an asymmetrical hem. Beneath the top is a dress that features a pink bodice with diagonal stripes and a light blue mesh skirt. Under the skirt are black capri leggings with a serrated hem. Completing the outfit are mismatched blue wedges; the right is a gladiator sandal and the left is a winding snake-strap sandal.\nJane loves to accessorize. She has a light blue bone with feathers in one ear and a light blue claw in the other. Around her neck is a red three ring choker attached to a statement necklace with claws. On one arm is a dark blue bracelet and the other has a black fishnet sleeve, pink bangle, and light blue bangle. Around her waist is a dark blue belt decorated with three skullettes; the center one is larger with a red bow and hanging feathers. \nShe carries a dark blue purse and walking stick. The quilted handbag has a red handle, feather, and skullette clasp. Inside the bag are three pieces of paper. The walking stick features blue feathers around a skullette knob with pink bow. The stick is also a working pen. Also included with the doll is a black brush, doll stand, Jane’s diary, and Needles, her pet sloth.\nAge: 15 or 16\n\nMonster Parents: Doctor Boolittle\n\nKiller Style: I suppose one would call my style jungle chic. I simply adore faux fur, animal prints and feathers. I also have an absolutely smashing walking stick I cannot stand to be without.\n\nFreaky Flaw: Spending my formative fears on a jungle island with only the companionship of animals did little to prepare me for the company of other monsters in large groups. When I find myself in that situation my pulse races, I breathe very fast and I start looking for places to hide.\n\nPet: Needles is my pet voodoo sloth. I love him dearly but he is always getting stuck so I constantly must make a point of telling him to be scareful.\n\nFavorite Activity: I love a good trek. There's nothing quite as peaceful and invigorating as exploring the wilderness and meeting the creatures that live there.",

It is topped by a silver rod with cutout wings. \nThe rod holds a curved white beam that holds a purple crystal ball. The ball lights up and will flash to the beat of music. It is magnetized and enables Astranova to float under it.\nAstranova\nAstranova has a light blue crystal head piece with an ornate metallic crystal microphone and earpiece. She has dark blue hair with tinsel streaks and starry features on her face. There are two versions; one is light purple and the other is darker.\nHer halterneck dress is white with a fuchsia print of constellation lines. On the back are layered capes that are sheer white and lavender.\nOver the dress is a dark magenta crystal chest piece that flares at the shoulders and wraps her waist. She has metallic wrist cuffs and magenta crystal shoes that rise up to her knees. Her musical instrument is a magenta crystal guitar.\nComet fever has infected the city! A magical comet returns after a 1300-year orbit, bringing with it a surprise that's out-of-this-world!\n\nAstranova doll \nDaughter of the Comet Aliens\n\nAge: 15 (space years)\n\nKiller Style: I love glam rock. The more sparkle and out-of-this-world shine the better. My quest is to be the most dazzling object in a universe full of stars!\n\nFreaky Flaw: After traveling for lightyears, sometimes I have difficulty navigating Monster High. What I'm trying to say gets lost in translation, or I don't get my new ghoulfriends' fangisms, and then I feel like our conversations just orbit 'round and 'round.\n\nFavorite Activity: Singing.

		"description": "Kjersti is an adorable troll with pink skin, pointy ears, and eyes with pixelated irises. Her hair is a blend of blue and magenta streaks. It is long and curly and pulled into side ponytails.\nShe is wearing a black top with a white image of a pixelated skullette viking. The top has a purple strap and short colorful sleeves made up of various shades of blue and purple pixels. Her layered skirt features pointed panels reminiscent of armor. The panels are shimmery purple, outlined in black, and trimmed with black mesh. The longer bottom layer matches the sleeves of her top and has an irregular pixelated hem.\nAccessories for the outfit consist of a teal knit cap with horns, pixelated magenta glasses, blue pixelated skullette viking earrings, and a black bracelet. On her feet are pastel teal socks complementing pastel purple boots with pixelated soles, game controller accents, and skullettes on the sides. Her zippered gray bag is shaped like a video game controller with pink buttons and a black handle.\nKjersti also comes with a black brush, doll stand, and her diary.\nKiller Style: I'm a gamer and I like giving my wardrobe a turbo boost of cute with scary-sweet, game-themed skirts, t-shirts and shoes. I think it's nice to feel fashionable, especially when I'm kicking another gamer's character all over the screen.\n\nFavorite Activity: I love playing video games with monsters from all over the world. Even though we've never met face to face, I feel like they're my friends.\n\nFreaky Flaw: I'm a control freak. I think that's why I like gaming, because I can make the characters I'm playing do whatever I \"tell\" them to do and if they don't, I can always reset the game. Alas, there are no reset buttons in real unlife.\n\nPet: Would it be weird if I said my video game console?",

Her curly hair is dark purple with hints of blue and her skin is a wonderful luminous green.\nShe is wearing a semi-sheer lavender dress with frilly sleeves, black shoulder guards, a frilly black lace neckline, and two black bands around the waist. The skirt transitions from lavender to a green and black floral print with a jagged hem. The print features leaves with prickly ivy and is accentuated by strips of purple lace ruffles.\nUnder the dress is a tube top and miniskirt. The top is green with a leafy black ivy print and the skirt is black leatherette.\nBlack accessories consist of a Corpse Flower hair clip, dangle earrings, a vine necklace, and a spiked bangle. On her feet are black peep-toe pumps with leaf straps and flower bulb heels. Complementing the shoes are green vine anklets with purple flower accents. Her black purse features a floral design and a vine shoulder strap.\nIncluded with Amanita is a brush, doll stand, iCoffin phone, a purple modeling portfolio with her headshot, and her diary.\nKiller Style: Amanita Nightshade's carefully cultivated look makes every other flower in the garden of style look like a weed by comparison. It isn't as if they are lacking in color, but their arrangement appears merely budding when planted next to Amanita's full bloom of fashion.\n\nFavorite Activity: Amanita loves being adored and celebrated for her inherent beauty - both inside and out.\n\nFreaky Flaw: Amanita believes there's nothing so wonderful as the sound of her own melodic voice, but there are many who feel that perhaps their voices are equally important. Amanita spent many years pondering this and yet still sees little merit in the argument.\n\nPet: Amanita has an adoring maggot that is die-ring as both pet and accessory.",

She is wearing khaki coveralls with orange lightning bolt stripes and a name tag with “Stein” on the chest. On the right shoulder is a Ghostbusters logo patch. The legs have real cargo pockets and a sheer yellow cloth is tied around her left leg.\nShe accessorizes with yellow lightning glasses, blue lightning hoop earrings, and a silver dog tag. Around her waist are two belts. The first is silver with a lightning bolt buckle and the second one is a blue utility belt with a Skullette carabiner. She wears black wrist cuffs and black molded fingerless gloves. On her feet are high black boots with orange lightning down the fronts, zippers on the sides, and jagged lightning platforms.\nGhostbusting accessories feature an iconic black proton pack with a translucent yellow cable that connects to the gun. The proton pack opens and can store the translucent green slimer figure. Frankie’s last item is a black clip-on walkie-talkie.\nWho Ya Gonna Call?\nFrankie Stein!\n\nIt's not every day that there are ghosts at Monster High! Oh, wait, yes it is. But, paranormally, there aren't trespassing ghosts who zip around the howlways and classrooms leaving a trail of... ewww... slime!\n\nClawdeen found the little green slimer in her locker next to her ruined shoes. Then Ghoulia spied him wreaking havoc on the computer lab. Drac tried to catch him, but have you ever tried to fly when you've got slime on your wings? And Cleo - let's just say she took one look at the mess and felt royally ill.\n\nSo supernaturally, they called Frankie! She's a ghoul who doesn't mind lending a hand - sometimes literally - and a little ectoplasm dripping off her stitches isn't going to spoil her school spirit.\n\nFrankie got to work! She strapped on a proton pack and fired neutralizing particles like a pro... until it was hard to tell who caused more mayhem - Frankie or Slimer.\n\nFrankie chased down the howl, past the clawditorium and into the creepateria...\n\nEvery monster who had lunch that period was treated to a spooktacular show! Slimer bounced from tray to tray, gobbling down tater tots, chomping pizza slices, tossing Shriek salads, and wow, can he guzzle milk! All the while, Frankie was hot on his oozy tail, doing flips, somersaults, even the occasional pirouette!\n\nBut then Frankie had a voltageous idea! \"Hey Slimer,\" she called out to the happily munching ghost, \"why don't you join us? Grab a bite and fang out!\" Slimer stopped. No one had ever asked him to eat with them before! So Slimer joined the ghouls and had a grave time! And he ate every last bite... off everyone else's trays. But the ghouls didn't mind - he's really kind of cute once you get to know him... after he stops sliming you.\n\n",

		"description": "The 2-pack features Cleo de Nile and Ghoulia Yelps. It is an exclusive of the Mattel Shop.\nCleo de Nile\nCleo has long black hair with blunt bangs, glitter highlights, and teal streaks. She has a tan complexion, light blue eyes, elaborate eye makeup, deep red lips, and a turquoise gem on her cheek.\nHer outfit is a black jumpsuit with elbow length sleeves and knee length legs. It is detailed with a print of winding golden lines and turquoise graphics.\nShe accessorizes with coral snakes on a gold statement necklace, gold armbands, and a gold cage peplum. On her head is an ornate gold headband decorated with a teal cobra. Her sandals have sparkly teal soles and golden straps with coral accents that wind up her legs.\nAccompanying Cleo is Hissette. The cobra is gold with a turquoise crown and jewelry.\nGhoulia Yelps\nGhoulia has long wavy hair that is streaked light and dark blue. She has a pale gray complexion, pale blue eyes, and red lips.\nHer outfit has a gray shirt with a breast pocket, black cuffs and trim, red buttons, and a drippy hem. The knee-length shorts are a pinstripe blue decorated with a turquoise skull print.\nAccessories consist of a bright green explorer hat, red zombie arm earrings, blue cat eye glasses, a turquoise scarf, and a red brain belt. On her feet are black knee-high boots with red laces and bright green heels. She carries a black torch with orange flame and a gray satchel with a red zombie hand graphic. \nWith Ghoulia is Sir Hoots A Lot. The owl is bright green with yellow eyes and blue accents.\nIf you have ever been trapped in a pyramid for thousands of years, you know how dreadfully boring it can be. If you were also trapped in that pyramid with only your pet cobra to keep you company and aid in your pranks against your rather abhorrent sister, you can imagine how \"poor\" (but actually quite wealthy) Cleo felt - entombed in an opulent palace with all of the luxuries her royal family had to offer, but no one there to admire and worship her. If you know all of that, you understand why she began to scream of a mysterious and bespectacled ghoul who would one day rescue her, befriend her, and, of course, idolize her. It was surely her destiny.\n\nIt is a little know fact that zombies are among the brainiest monsters in the world. They are often buried in deep thoughts and are able to solve mysteries and piece together puzzles much faster than their slow gait or moaning dialect would imply. As Ghoulia often says\"urghhhghgh ghrrrhhhh uhhhh,\" which roughly translates to \"I'm busy and enunciation is overrated.\" And, in fact, Ghoulia has been monstrously busy lately because she found what only a zombie with her superior intellect would consider \"a clue.\" Donning her hat and calling Sir Hoots-A-Lot, she sets off on an archeological expedition to dig up a grave treasure - the princess destined to be her true ghoulfriend.",
