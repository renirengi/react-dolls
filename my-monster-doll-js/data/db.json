She is wearing a green sleeveless tee with black tiger print and gold trim. Over the shirt is a black leatherette vest with a purple collar, purple hem, and gold zipper. Around her waist is a black belt with gold hoops that accentuate her purple capri pants. The pants lead into gold knee-high peep-toe  boots with black heels. The second outfit is a shimmery purple & black bandage dress; the black portions feature a golden leopard print. The dress has black & gold straps and a frilly black & gold hem. Lastly she has a purple long sleeve shirt with an image of a wolf on the front. It has a green & black tiger print collar, cuffs, and hem. Completing the wardrobe are dark blue shorts covered with shiny gold splatter. Clawdeen has two extra pairs of shoes. They are studded black pumps with fang-shaped heels and purple lace-up booties that have white skulls on the sides. Accessories consist of a black armband, green armband, black studded bracelets, gold bangles, green bangles, a gold multi-finger ring, and a purple fingerless glove on her right hand. Two translucent purple hoops are in her right ear and two translucent green hoops are in her left ear. The doll’s green purse resembles a boombox with black speakers and knobs. Clawdeen comes with a brush and a doll stand. The doll may also be referred to as “I Heart Fashion Clawdeen Wolf”. It's no secret that I love all things fashion related, and even though lately I've been designing my own line I still like to go to the maul, especially to check out the shoes. I must confess that shoe design is the weak part of my game. I think it's because they're kind of like ice cream to me. I know the ingredients, I know how it's made, but sometimes I'd rather just enjoy instead of focusing on all the details.  xx Clawdeen",

Sure, now being a more traditional ghoul my own self I'm not one to be chasing after every fashion will-o-wisp that comes floating over the moor, don't you know. But every once in a green moon I like to carry myself over to the maul and do a bit of looking around. I usually end up though at a fashionably frightening little boutique where the owner can practically read me mind, which is a good thing, since it's terribly hard to ask for help when the store lurk interprets every question as a pronouncement of doom.  xx Scarah",

Her hair is pulled into a pony tail with a hair bump and is held by a red hairband adorned with a skullette surrounded by feathers. She is wearing a purple & blue leaf print top with black faux fur shoulders and an asymmetrical hem. Beneath the top is a dress that features a pink bodice with diagonal stripes and a light blue mesh skirt. Under the skirt are black capri leggings with a serrated hem. Completing the outfit are mismatched blue wedges; the right is a gladiator sandal and the left is a winding snake-strap sandal. Jane loves to accessorize. She has a light blue bone with feathers in one ear and a light blue claw in the other. Around her neck is a red three ring choker attached to a statement necklace with claws. On one arm is a dark blue bracelet and the other has a black fishnet sleeve, pink bangle, and light blue bangle. Around her waist is a dark blue belt decorated with three skullettes; the center one is larger with a red bow and hanging feathers.  She carries a dark blue purse and walking stick. The quilted handbag has a red handle, feather, and skullette clasp. Inside the bag are three pieces of paper. The walking stick features blue feathers around a skullette knob with pink bow. The stick is also a working pen. Also included with the doll is a black brush, doll stand, Jane’s diary, and Needles, her pet sloth. Age: 15 or 16  Monster Parents: Doctor Boolittle  Killer Style: I suppose one would call my style jungle chic. I simply adore faux fur, animal prints and feathers. I also have an absolutely smashing walking stick I cannot stand to be without.  Freaky Flaw: Spending my formative fears on a jungle island with only the companionship of animals did little to prepare me for the company of other monsters in large groups. When I find myself in that situation my pulse races, I breathe very fast and I start looking for places to hide.  Pet: Needles is my pet voodoo sloth. I love him dearly but he is always getting stuck so I constantly must make a point of telling him to be scareful.  Favorite Activity: I love a good trek. There's nothing quite as peaceful and invigorating as exploring the wilderness and meeting the creatures that live there.",

Under the top is a red skirt held by a white belt with a skull buckle featuring six red spider eyes. Attached to the belt is Webarella’s silver lasso. On her feet are silver studded knee-high spiderweb boots with red heels. The costume is accessorized with silver spiderweb earrings, a red fingerless glove, and six bracelets, one for each arm. The bracelets consist of two white double hoops, a silver double hoop, a red double hoop, a spiked red band, and a spiked silver band. Wydowna has also brought a change of clothes to the event. She has a white, red & black sleeveless dress with a collage of comic book phrases like “Boom!”, “Pow!”, and “Bamm!”. To complement the dress there is a wide black spiderweb belt, silver pants, and red & black spiderweb heels. This exclusive of the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con also includes a black brush, Wydowna’s diary, a mini Webarella comic, and Shoo, her pet fly.",

I mean, if you're going to rattle around, you might as well be fashionable while you're doing so.  Freaky Flaw: I guess some monsters think I'm a bit of an air fin, but what I actually am is a daydreamer. I'm always floating away in my thoughts, on land or sea.  Favorite Activity: I'm super curious, so I love to treasure hunt in the sea and go to antique stores on land. I love scaring up unique and special freaky findings.  Favorite School Subject: Archaeology. It's like a new adventure every day because you never know what's going to wash up with the tide.",

Cleo is wearing a full body suit with only one sleeve. The black, pink, and beige suit has a mummy wrap appearance with a sheer dress over top. The dress is turquoise mesh with gold cross straps and a black chest wrap. It is held around the waist by a translucent black belt. On her feet are turquoise knee-high boots embellished with gold skulls up the sides. Her second outfit is a long sleeve dress with vertical black and turquoise stripes. The turquoise stripes have a pattern of mummy wrappings. Around the waist is a gold belt with triangle spacers and a dangling chain. Lastly, she has a cream top covered with colorful hieroglyphics. Around the waist is a golden sash which leads to a shimmery pink skirt with a bandage pattern. A black cropped jacket is worn over the top. It has long sleeves and features gold squares along the trim.  Two additional pairs of shoes are included with the doll. The gold platform heels have ouroboros ankle straps and pyramids for soles. The translucent black shoes are held up by Anubis heels. Accessories consist of translucent black sunglasses, translucent turquoise triangle earrings, gold earrings, a translucent black snake necklace, three gold triangle bangles, and a translucent turquoise ouroboros bracelet. Her purse is gold with a scarab on the side. Cleo comes with a brush and a doll stand. The doll may also be referred to as “I Heart Fashion Cleo de Nile”. Most ghouls have lots of misconceptions about me, like they think I have hoards of servants who go out and do all my shopping for me. Okay, well, that is actually true, but sometimes I like to go to the maul myself and do my own shopping, especially for shoes and accessories. Regardless, even if I did have a servant whose foot was as perfectly formed as my own, I still wouldn't let her choose my shoes because just because it fits doesn't mean it's comfortable, and there are some things even a princess must do for herself.  xx Cleo",

      "description": "Venus has gone all out for this Toys”R”Us exclusive. One side of her pink and green hair has been shaved short and then checkered with pink and black. She comes with three awesome outfits, three pairs of shoes, and lots of accessories. Venus is wearing a long black top covered with a green ivy pattern and pink & white graphics. One sleeve and part of the top is made of black lace. Her capri pants are a pattern of tiny pink squares and black spatter. On her feet are black lace-up boots with ivy filigree. Her second outfit is a black & white checkered sleeveless dress covered with pink & green Venus flytraps. A black choker strap with silver circles goes down the front of the dress to the waist. The hem is trimmed with two layers of tulle; one is black and the other is pink. The final ensemble begins with a pink top under a black & green ivy vest. Across the front of the top is serrated black fishnet held by a green strip. Completing the outfit is a mini skirt covered with pink & white splatter. Additional shoes include pink boots with large cuffs and black pumps with twisty heels. Accessories consist of translucent pink sunglasses, black hook earrings, black safety pin earrings, green square earrings, a green studded bracelet, a white studded bracelet, a wide pink studded bracelet, a wide white studded bracelet, and a white studded belt.  She also has translucent black ivy wraps for her forearms and calves. The doll’s pink purse has a pink with white zipper on the side, green ivy edging, and green ivy handles. Venus comes with a brush and a doll stand. The doll may also be referred to as “I Heart Fashion Venus McFlytrap”. It often takes a while for certain fashions to grow on me, so sometimes I like to go to the maul, find a nice boutique and just soak up the style; and although I don't have the same kind of cultivated fashion sense as everyone else, I do like planting myself in every pair of shoes in the place. I mean seriously though, if a ghoul is going to fashionably bloom, her roots need to be solidly grounded in some freakishly fab footwear, especially if you don't want to spend your unlife as wallflower.  xx Venus",

It's not like I want tae ruin a shot, but it's just so much fun.  Favorite Activity: Aye, it's photo bombing, but not just the ordinary kind. I like tae find ways tae get into a shot that are not so obvious, so ya might not see me when you look at a picture the first time.  Pet: I always wanted a dry land pet like a Highland cow, but when you live in a loch there's nae place tae keep one.",

      "description": "Marisol has bright pink hair with two bright green braided pigtails at the sides. She is taller than the average ghoul with oversized feet, lavender gray skin, and fur on her forearms and ankles. Her colorful outfit begins with a pink strapless top under a cropped jacket. The orange jacket is decorated with green footprints and squiggly lines made up of blue, pink, and black. Her double skirt features a black top layer with intricate pink and green zigzag designs and rows of colorful flora and footprints. The underskirt is longer and bright green. Accessories consist of a headband with a bright green bowler hat and orange tassels at the ends of her pigtails. On her feet are pink peep-toe wedges adorned with zigzags, triangle cutouts, braids, and bright green tassels. Her bright green bag is trimmed with zigzags and etched with monstrous footprints. Included with Marisol is a black brush, doll stand, black skullette passport, and a Monster Picchu passport diary.  Killer Style: I like BIG & LOUD! Colors, fashions, music, hair - everything goes to \"12\" with me except my feet; they're way off the chart because they're simply too gore-geous to be measured. So when you see me coming, and I can't be missed, in my colorful modern take on traditional Monster Picchu fashions, just remember #BigHairDon'tScare.  Favorite Activity: I love getting new nail art! It is the most perfect way to accent my best features, and what ghoul doesn't like getting a mani-pedi?  Freaky Flaw: My parents say that even when I whisper I'm still about as quiet as an avalanche, but I am simply larger than unlife and I cannot hide, not that I would want to, what I am feeling inside.  Pet: I love llamas, even though I do not have one as a pet. I mean, how could I not love them? They are fuzzy and quirky and are as much a part of Monster Picchu as I am.",

Seeing their faces fright up at the unnatural wonder of it never gets old.  Freaky Flaw: I have a real hang up with monsters who choose to stay in the dark when it comes to protecting the world where we unlive. This is the only world we have and we shouldn't be turning a blind eye when it comes to taking care of it.  Pet: Pet? Perish the thought.",

Killer Style: I love to mix tribal patterns with fringe and eye popping colors to create a modern look that stays true to my monster heritage. I also like my fashions to be flexible and comfy because I'm prone to breaking out in spontaneous dance.  Favorite Activity: I love to dance above all other things and any excuse to dance is a good one.  Freaky Flaw: It is kind of embarrassing, but I have this effect on mansters that makes them fall hoof over antler for me. Unfortunately, they usually end up falling on their heart.  Pet: The birds of the air and beasts of the field are all my friends. I would not want to cause jealousy by picking one over the other.",

It is long and curly and pulled into side ponytails. She is wearing a black top with a white image of a pixelated skullette viking. The top has a purple strap and short colorful sleeves made up of various shades of blue and purple pixels. Her layered skirt features pointed panels reminiscent of armor.

Accessories for the outfit consist of a teal knit cap with horns, pixelated magenta glasses, blue pixelated skullette viking earrings, and a black bracelet. On her feet are pastel teal socks complementing pastel purple boots with pixelated soles, game controller accents, and skullettes on the sides. Her zippered gray bag is shaped like a video game controller with pink buttons and a black handle. Kjersti also comes with a black brush, doll stand, and her diary. Killer Style: I'm a gamer and I like giving my wardrobe a turbo boost of cute with scary-sweet, game-themed skirts, t-shirts and shoes. I think it's nice to feel fashionable, especially when I'm kicking another gamer's character all over the screen.  Favorite Activity: I love playing video games with monsters from all over the world. Even though we've never met face to face, I feel like they're my friends.  Freaky Flaw: I'm a control freak. I think that's why I like gaming, because I can make the characters I'm playing do whatever I \"tell\" them to do and if they don't, I can always reset the game. Alas, there are no reset buttons in real unlife.  Pet: Would it be weird if I said my video game console?",

Killer Style: Being somewhat larger than unlife makes it impossible to buy my clothes \"off the rack\" so everything I wear has to be stitched together by claw from material found around the Freak Du Chic.

But when I step outside of this freaktacular world, I feel like I don't fit in and become very nervous! So much so, I literally begin to shake like Jelly!

      "description": "Amanita is a sight to behold with her stunning features and amazing ensemble. Her curly hair is dark purple with hints of blue and her skin is a wonderful luminous green. She is wearing a semi-sheer lavender dress with frilly sleeves, black shoulder guards, a frilly black lace neckline, and two black bands around the waist. The skirt transitions from lavender to a green and black floral print with a jagged hem. The print features leaves with prickly ivy and is accentuated by strips of purple lace ruffles. Under the dress is a tube top and miniskirt. The top is green with a leafy black ivy print and the skirt is black leatherette. Black accessories consist of a Corpse Flower hair clip, dangle earrings, a vine necklace, and a spiked bangle. On her feet are black peep-toe pumps with leaf straps and flower bulb heels. Complementing the shoes are green vine anklets with purple flower accents. Her black purse features a floral design and a vine shoulder strap. Included with Amanita is a brush, doll stand, iCoffin phone, a purple modeling portfolio with her headshot, and her diary. Killer Style: Amanita Nightshade's carefully cultivated look makes every other flower in the garden of style look like a weed by comparison. It isn't as if they are lacking in color, but their arrangement appears merely budding when planted next to Amanita's full bloom of fashion.  Favorite Activity: Amanita loves being adored and celebrated for her inherent beauty - both inside and out.  Freaky Flaw: Amanita believes there's nothing so wonderful as the sound of her own melodic voice, but there are many who feel that perhaps their voices are equally important. Amanita spent many years pondering this and yet still sees little merit in the argument.  Pet: Amanita has an adoring maggot that is die-ring as both pet and accessory.",

The body is lavender with a print of silver chains and magenta diamonds surrounded by lined sheet music. The hem is purple with a black tulle ruffle.

And if it makes them want to dance too, even better!  Personal Style: Boohemian Rocker. When I'm belting out pop ballads under hot stage frights, I like to wear cool, gauzy fabrics that float around me, while still looking shriek and modern.  Monster Quirk: I can turn solid, but not for long. When I try to blend in with normies, there's always a ghost of a chance that I'll spook out and be discovered.  There was a time when monsters unlived in hiding because they feared being \"different.\" But then the ghouls met, and they understood that it's clawesome to be different!

Around the waist is a black peplum with a reverse scalloped hem. The pink skirt has a black net print decorated with a pattern of blue hearts and black bows.

The legs have real cargo pockets and a sheer yellow cloth is tied around her left leg. She accessorizes with yellow lightning glasses, blue lightning hoop earrings, and a silver dog tag. Around her waist are two belts. The first is silver with a lightning bolt buckle and the second one is a blue utility belt with a Skullette carabiner. She wears black wrist cuffs and black molded fingerless gloves. On her feet are high black boots with orange lightning down the fronts, zippers on the sides, and jagged lightning platforms. Ghostbusting accessories feature an iconic black proton pack with a translucent yellow cable that connects to the gun. The proton pack opens and can store the translucent green slimer figure. Frankie’s last item is a black clip-on walkie-talkie. Who Ya Gonna Call? Frankie Stein!  It's not every day that there are ghosts at Monster High! Oh, wait, yes it is. But, paranormally, there aren't trespassing ghosts who zip around the howlways and classrooms leaving a trail of... ewww... slime!  Clawdeen found the little green slimer in her locker next to her ruined shoes. Then Ghoulia spied him wreaking havoc on the computer lab. Drac tried to catch him, but have you ever tried to fly when you've got slime on your wings? And Cleo - let's just say she took one look at the mess and felt royally ill.  So supernaturally, they called Frankie! She's a ghoul who doesn't mind lending a hand - sometimes literally - and a little ectoplasm dripping off her stitches isn't going to spoil her school spirit.  Frankie got to work! She strapped on a proton pack and fired neutralizing particles like a pro... until it was hard to tell who caused more mayhem - Frankie or Slimer.  Frankie chased down the howl, past the clawditorium and into the creepateria...  Every monster who had lunch that period was treated to a spooktacular show! Slimer bounced from tray to tray, gobbling down tater tots, chomping pizza slices, tossing Shriek salads, and wow, can he guzzle milk! All the while, Frankie was hot on his oozy tail, doing flips, somersaults, even the occasional pirouette!  But then Frankie had a voltageous idea! \"Hey Slimer,\" she called out to the happily munching ghost, \"why don't you join us? Grab a bite and fang out!\" Slimer stopped. No one had ever asked him to eat with them before! So Slimer joined the ghouls and had a grave time! And he ate every last bite... off everyone else's trays. But the ghouls didn't mind - he's really kind of cute once you get to know him... after he stops sliming you.  ",

Holding her pigtails are hair clips that match the headdress. Her skeletal features are accentuated by light blue eyeshadow, pink lipstick with stitch accents, and flowery sugar skull makeup. She is wearing an amazing dress that has a sleeveless black bodice decorated with colorful flower outlines, a pink neckline, and a blue crochet ruffle trim. The shiny black skirt features a dense pattern of pink, purple, and blue flowers with green leafy accents. Under the skirt is a sheer white petticoat with an embroidered lace hem made up of sugar skulls and heart designs.  On her feet are decorative pink wedges. They are covered with woven straps and have yellow emblems with “MH” and festive skulls. Skelita comes with her diary and an ornate black stand adorned with Skullettes, flowers, and a sugar skull on the base. I scream to dance among the humans...  Every autumn, when there is a bite in the air, the undead are invited by their living familia to cross over to the human world for a monstrous reunion. This spooktacular celebration is Dia de los Muertos - the Day of the Dead - and it is my favorite howliday - filled with bootiful costumes, to-die-for feasts, and, of course, dancing!  Ever since I was a bebé, I have attended the reunion with Abuelita - my grandmother - but this year she is unable to make the journey. I am un poco worried that without her, I will not receive my own welcome. But being a hopeful monster, I will dress up, put marigolds in my hair, and wait for my candlelit invitation to appear and guide me to the human world...",

She is a budget doll and lacks articulation at the elbows and wrists. Her outfit is a sleeveless black romper with a turquoise scale print on the front. Around her waist is a pink twisted rope with a seahorse accent. On her feet are coral pink wedges with double straps, seashells on the fronts, and spiral seashells etched on the heels. Safety equipment includes turquoise seashell elbow and knee pads and a pink helmet. The helmet is decorated with a Skullette on the front, wave designs, and a dorsal fin. Scooter/Surf Board The surf board is pink with a Skullette emblem, bubbles, and a turquoise outline. At the back is a turquoise fin and a cutout bite mark.  To convert the board into a scooter there are three turquoise tentacle wheels with silver Skullette brackets that clip to the bottom. The handlebars are pink tentacles with a white starfish attached to a silver retractable stem that clips to the top of the board. Lastly, Lagoona has a pink coral backback. It is oversized and designed to store all the pieces of the scooter when it is used as a surf board. How Do I Boo? I float! I'm very chill in and out of the water. I try not to sweat things, but when I do I just swim it off.  Personal Style: I keep it casual, from sporty cute to surfer chic, so I'm always up for whatever's going on that sounds fun.  Monster Quirk: When I'm out of water too long, I develop frightfully dry skin. I slather on so much skin cream, sometimes I'm as slippery as an eel-monster.  Lagoona is always a ghoul on the go... whether shes hanging 10 on her trusty surfboard, or zipping around on her speedy scooter. So leave it to Lagoona to sport a 2-in-1 combo: Her surfboard transforms into a scooter, and the extra parts are stored in her shell-shaped backpack.",

      "description": "Draculaura has black hair with pink streaks that is curled and pulled to the back. She has shimmery eyeshadow, pink lips, and her signature heart under her left eye. Her nautical themed dress has a white top with short sleeves double striped with pink. The wide sailor collar is black and trimmed with pink. Decorating the pink and white striped skirt are stars, broken hearts, anchors, bats, and rope hearts. The skirt is trimmed with two ruffled tulle hems; one blue and one black. Accessories start with a white headband sailor cap decorated with a pink heart & anchor emblem. The yellow earrings are rope hearts with bats and the matching necklace is a rope bow tie outline. Molded pink elbow length gloves with blue dots cover her hands. On her feet are sheer pink knee high socks with heart-shaped polka dots. Her golden rope shoes have high platforms and bat accents. The pink cutout tote bag has gold rope straps with heart-shaped handles. Count Fabulous, her pet bat is included. He has a pink bow on his head and is wearing a white shirt with pink hearts, a pink scalloped collar, and a pink hem. Shiver me tombers! The ghouls set sail after Draculaura finds a map featuring a big treasure-y X! But when the seas get choppy, it doesn't take long to discover that none of these wannabe-pirates have sea legs - not even Lagoona! And Rochelle is more anchor than sailor! It's only a matter of time before their adventurous vacation is all washed up!",

      "description": "The 2-pack features Cleo de Nile and Ghoulia Yelps. It is an exclusive of the Mattel Shop. Cleo de Nile Cleo has long black hair with blunt bangs, glitter highlights, and teal streaks. She has a tan complexion, light blue eyes, elaborate eye makeup, deep red lips, and a turquoise gem on her cheek. Her outfit is a black jumpsuit with elbow length sleeves and knee length legs. It is detailed with a print of winding golden lines and turquoise graphics. She accessorizes with coral snakes on a gold statement necklace, gold armbands, and a gold cage peplum. On her head is an ornate gold headband decorated with a teal cobra. Her sandals have sparkly teal soles and golden straps with coral accents that wind up her legs. Accompanying Cleo is Hissette. The cobra is gold with a turquoise crown and jewelry. Ghoulia Yelps Ghoulia has long wavy hair that is streaked light and dark blue. She has a pale gray complexion, pale blue eyes, and red lips. Her outfit has a gray shirt with a breast pocket, black cuffs and trim, red buttons, and a drippy hem. The knee-length shorts are a pinstripe blue decorated with a turquoise skull print. Accessories consist of a bright green explorer hat, red zombie arm earrings, blue cat eye glasses, a turquoise scarf, and a red brain belt. On her feet are black knee-high boots with red laces and bright green heels. She carries a black torch with orange flame and a gray satchel with a red zombie hand graphic.  With Ghoulia is Sir Hoots A Lot. The owl is bright green with yellow eyes and blue accents. If you have ever been trapped in a pyramid for thousands of years, you know how dreadfully boring it can be. If you were also trapped in that pyramid with only your pet cobra to keep you company and aid in your pranks against your rather abhorrent sister, you can imagine how \"poor\" (but actually quite wealthy) Cleo felt - entombed in an opulent palace with all of the luxuries her royal family had to offer, but no one there to admire and worship her. If you know all of that, you understand why she began to scream of a mysterious and bespectacled ghoul who would one day rescue her, befriend her, and, of course, idolize her. It was surely her destiny.  It is a little know fact that zombies are among the brainiest monsters in the world. They are often buried in deep thoughts and are able to solve mysteries and piece together puzzles much faster than their slow gait or moaning dialect would imply. As Ghoulia often says\"urghhhghgh ghrrrhhhh uhhhh,\" which roughly translates to \"I'm busy and enunciation is overrated.\" And, in fact, Ghoulia has been monstrously busy lately because she found what only a zombie with her superior intellect would consider \"a clue.\" Donning her hat and calling Sir Hoots-A-Lot, she sets off on an archeological expedition to dig up a grave treasure - the princess destined to be her true ghoulfriend.",
